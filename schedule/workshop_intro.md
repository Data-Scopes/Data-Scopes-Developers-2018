# Workshop Data Scopes

Coherent methods for research with heterogeneous digital resources

  - _Data scope_: gathering different datasets and cleaning, supplementing and linking them to be able to do analyses that spring from research questions
  - there is little consensus how to proceed
  - there is little understanding about the processes involved and how they influence further steps (such as analysis)
  - often (falsely) regarded as a preparation of 'real research'

## Workshop purpose

The purpose of the workshop is to make researchers aware of the different aspects of dealing with large-scale data. With data scopes we wan t to achieve the following:

- __insight into data processing__: processing data is an essential and inseparable part of research and not just an inevitable technical process after which the real research can begin
- __transparancy of research__: make research based on the processing and analysis of large and complex data more Transparent
- __methodological discussion__: consolidate digital methods in order to come to coherent and broadly supported research methodologies
- __develop modes of collaboration__: collecting, cleaning and linking data requires a lot of knowledge, of technical as well as content matters

## Workshop design

- __Tutorial__: explanation of data scopes concepts
- __Hands-on sessions__: work in small groups on assignments relating to data scopes concepts
    + **be creative**: assignments have no 'right solutions', we do not have the correct answers ourselves
    + **zen**: assignments will be a mess, everything goes wrong, but that is part of the deal and they will turn out alright again
    + **Discussion**: compare groups assignments, reflect on data scopes as a means to tackle the research process
