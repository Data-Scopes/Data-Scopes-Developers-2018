## Step 1: Creating a Data Scope

- Finish the mapping of the crawled dataset to the ODBR data model,
- Export the crawled dataset to CSV,
- Export the Open Refine steps to a JSON file,
- Create a file that documents the most important choices, decisions and interpretations. 

## Step 2: Share your Data Scope

Go to the SurfDrive folder and add the three documents (CSV, JSON and documentation) to the folder we made for your group.

Once all groups have done this, get the documents from the group next to you and try to merge their edited version of the crawled data to your version of ODBR dataset, by applying the same steps.

Look at their documentation and consider the following questions:
- What is most useful in documentation?
- Is anything not useful or unclear in documentation?
- Is anything missing in documentation?
- Are there differences between what you documented for your data scope and what the other group did?


Back to research question:
- What is the relation between the data scope and the research question? Was research question clear?
- What did you focus on in doing the data processing? 
- Is anything pushed to the background?
- How have interpretation, choices and decisions changed the data?
- Do these transformations create the impression that there's more structure than there actually is/was? Is that a problem? Whose interpretations are these?

### Methdology discussion

A general question:
- Who's task is this? 

Reflection on process:
- Open Refine as interface for communicating
- adding columns with source of information
- creating a separate dataset of records that were removed
- right level of communication between scholars and developers
  - spreadsheet operations are conceptually close to what some scholars do
  - spreadsheet operations are conceptually close to what programmers do
