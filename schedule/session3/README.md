## Step 1: Creating a Data Scope

- Finish the mapping of the crawled dataset to the ODBR data model,
- Create a file that documents the most important choices, decisions and interpretations. 

## Step 2: Share your Data Scope

Go to the SurfDrive folder and add three documents to the folder we made for your group.

Once all groups have done this, get the documents from the group next to you and try to merge their edited version of the crawled data to your version of ODBR dataset, by applying the same steps.

Look at their documentation and consider the following questions:
- What is most useful in documentation?
- Is anything not useful or unclear in documentation?
- Is anything missing inn documentation?

Back to research question:
- Was research question clear?
- Is anything pushed to the background?
- How have interpretation, choices and decisions changed the data?

### Methdology discussion

A general question:
- Who's task is this? 

Reflection on process:
- Open Refine as interface for communicating
- adding columns with source of information
- creating a separate dataset of records that were removed
- right level of communication between scholars and developers
  - spreadsheet operations are conceptually close to what some scholars do
  - spreadsheet operations are conceptually close to what programmers do
